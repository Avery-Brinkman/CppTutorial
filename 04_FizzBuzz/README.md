# FizzBuzz

FizzBuzz is a well known Computer Science exercise where you print numbers, replacing the number with "Fizz" if it's divisible by 3, "Buzz" if it's divisible by 5, and "FizzBuzz" if it's divisible by both.

In this code, the `main` function is just to check your work. You will write your own code that uses loops and if statements (don't worry about the pre-written code).

To check if a number is divisible by something else, you can use the modulo operator `%`. This divides a number by another, and returns the remainder.

Example:

```cpp
9 % 3 == 0; // 9 divided by 3 has a quotient of 3 and a remainder of 0
5 % 2 == 1; // 5 divided by 2 has a quotient of 2 and a remainder of 1
```

So, a number `n` is divisible by 3 if `n % 3 == 0`.
