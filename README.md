## Tools Needed

- [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/)\
    You'll want Visual Studio Community 2022. Visual Studio Code is a separate tool that's a lot more popular, but this is built around Visual Studio. The difference is that VSCode is really just a text editor, and is built for you to install extensions to customize how you'll use it. It's great for lighter weight languages like Python or JavaScript. Visual Studio, on the other hand is a full IDE (integrated development environment), and is more heavy weight. Visual Studio is built around compiling our code into executables and debugging said executables. It comes with a lot of the tools we need and doesn't require explicitly specifying where those tools are and how to use them.
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)\
    These tutorials won't really cover Git, but you will use it to actually get the code. For the puposes of these tutorials, just think of it as Google Drive for code (though that's a super incorrect description of it, and you shouldn't think of it like that if you were actually going to have to use Git).
- [CMake](https://cmake.org/download/) (Use the 'Windows x64 Installer')\
    This is going to be the tool that tells the computer and Visual Studio how to build the code and the project.

### Recomended Tools

- [Terminal](https://apps.microsoft.com/detail/9N0DX20HK701?hl=en-US&gl=US) (comes with Windows 11)\
    You can just use the normal Powershell that comes with Windows, but the Terminal app is nicer and has some cooler features and QoL upgrades.
